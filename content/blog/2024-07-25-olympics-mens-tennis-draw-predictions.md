Here is my draw prediction for the 2024 Olympics Men's singles draw.

I think Alcaraz will continue his hot run and win gold with Zverev getting silver. Not super certain about Djokovic winning bronze, his form is questionable so he could get knocked out in an earlier round. 

Medvedev is also questionable on clay. I'm definitely biased as a fan, although what I can say is he can surprise us by going deep or losing in the first round.

I would LOVE to see Djokovic-Nadal in the second round, but fate rarely gives us what we want, right? Well, I'd love to be proven wrong here.

Otherwise, tried to make the draw a bit unpredictable with a few upsets, but didn't think that hard about everything and ended up with the top four seeds in the semi-finals anyway.

Time will tell how wrong I am on this one.
