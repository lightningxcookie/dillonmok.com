If you haven't come across him yet, [Brandon Shepherd](https://www.youtube.com/@BrandonShep/featured) makes excellent YouTube videos where he'll take famous brands/logos and remix the designs in some way. His work is really awesome and makes me wish I had half the drawing skills or even patience that he has.

My favourite video of his is "I Overcomplicated Famous Brands". Check it out:
