In a bit of an unusual move, Apple has an ["exciting week of announcements"](https://x.com/gregjoz/status/1849484363165213148?s=46) for the Mac starting next week. You can find several articles reporting on what's rumoured/likely to be announced, so instead here's my list of things I would love to see Apple do but most likely will not happen. Oh well, a boy can dream.

- **USB-C peripherals**: this is an obvious one, but sadly it doesn't feel guaranteed at this point. It would be unsurprising for Apple to not touch the Magic Trackpad and Mouse yet again, leaving them with their old Lightning connectors for who knows how long.
- **Colourful MacBook Airs**: Apple made the colourful iMacs and they are wonderful. It seemed to be a one-off until the recent iPhone 16 colours, so we know that Apple is certainly still capable of delivering fun colours. Sure, Pros can't get colourful devices or whatever, but what about the MacBook Air then? That's not a "Pro" product, surely it deserves some fun. If you want your laptop to stand out, a colourful MacBook Air would be the perfect choice.
- **Colourful peripherals sold separately**: Apple make the colourful Magic Trackpad and Mouse with the iMacs, but you can't buy them separately. I've been interested in adding a Magic Trackpad to supplement the mouse on my desk. If Apple puts the colourful trackpads for sale individually next week, I will buy one, mark my words. (If you can't tell, I just want some more colours man.)
- **Updated Studio Display**: As a very happy Studio Display user, I would love to see more action on the monitor front. Even though I rarely use the webcam so it's not an issue for me (in fact, the monitor light bar I use covers it), I know it's a flaw with this product which should be greatly improved. Otherwise, I would be happy with minor improvements or a sign that Apple is still committed to this product so that people can buy it without feeling like they're buying a 2-year-old display that could be replaced at any time. 
- **M4 Extreme Mac Pro**: If this computer exists I will never buy it. I will probably never even see one in person, much less use it. But I'm of the opinion that Apple needs to make ridiculously fast computers and push the limits of what's possible, or make a ["halo car"](https://hypercritical.co/2013/03/08/the-case-for-a-true-mac-pro-successor), if you will. It's fun to see your favourite computer company make cool, crazy stuff.
