title: "Blackbox for Vision Pro"

Apple's Developer blog recently wrote [a feature](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=gvesi4wr) on Ryan McLeod's excellent puzzle game [Blackbox](https://www.blackboxpuzzles.com), and how he is working on a version for visionOS.

I'm a big fan of Blackbox on iOS. I love the creativity of the puzzles and out-of-the-box thinking it requires. For those lucky enough to get an Apple Vision Pro, Blackbox will definitely be a game to try out. I can't imagine the new possibilities for puzzles enabled on this new platform with entirely new interaction models and computing paradigms. I look forward to playing this game in 4-5 years when I can finally get my hands on whatever the current Vision hardware is at the time.
