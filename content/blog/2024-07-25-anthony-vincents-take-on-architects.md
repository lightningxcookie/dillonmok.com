Anthony Vincent, perhaps better known as [Ten Second Songs](https://www.youtube.com/@TenSecondSongs), recently made a video where he tries to sing ["Animals"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdWhJcrrjQs) by Architects by only listening to the instrumental track and reading the lyrics. It's super interesting to see how he approaches this song he's never heard before, and how close he got a few of the lines to the original. It's a great watch, and he also did one singing Bring Me The Horizon's "Can You Feel My Heart" with the same setup.

Of course, his video was inspired by [Drumeo](https://www.youtube.com/@DrumeoOfficial/videos), who have been killing it with drumming content on YouTube. I highly recommend watching Drumeo's content too, even if you're not a drummer it's super cool to get a closer look at killer musicians doing their thing.
