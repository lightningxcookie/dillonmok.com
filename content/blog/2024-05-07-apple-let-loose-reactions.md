title: "Apple’s Let Loose Event Reactions"
---
As it happened at 2am here in New Zealand, I didn't get to watch Apple's "Let Loose" event live. Instead I watched the replay of the keynote before diving into the product pages and social media. 

Here are my reactions to the event, written while watching it:

- Nice artistic intro graphics of Apple Park.
- Is this the first event in HDR? Shot on iPhone again?
- Biggest day for iPad. About time!
- iPad Air up first.
- John Ternus on the train? Makes sense.
- 11 and 13 inch Air. Just as expected
- Landscape camera. Finally!
- That guy put on AirPods Max. When are they gonna update them?
- Colours look kinda meh
- Magic Keyboard and old Apple Pencil live on.
- $599 is a solid starting price for the Air.
- iPad Pro time! "It's thinpossible"
- Black iPad Pro. Please???
- When John said "crush", he literally meant it.
- Thinnest Apple product. (iPad nano shoutout!)
- Space Black!
- Not just one OLED, but two OLED screens!
- "Tandem OLED"
- "Ultra Retina XDR" on both sizes- very nice!
- John Siracusa will love this.
- Nano-texture glass option. Rumours were pretty spot-on.
- M4! Apple is literally _racing_ with these chips.
- M4 is pretty good for AI, huh?
- "AI PC"?
- Up to 4x faster than M2 iPad Pro.
- Final Cut and Logic 2!
- Live Multicam and Final Cut Camera actually look pretty cool. 
- If Final Cut Camera works as a standalone camera, it will probably replace Blackmagic Camera in my workflow (Blackmagic Camera isn't super reliable for me)
- Session Players- Drummer, but for keyboards and bass! (When is this coming to the Mac version?)
- Stem splitter- nice to see Apple introducing AI features before WWDC. (I need this on the Mac version of Logic already!)
- Coloured/matte camera bump- that's new right?
- They did it. Landscape camera with Pencil charging on top!
- Function row on the new Magic Keyboard!
- Aluminium palmrest... is the whole thing aluminium?
- (That was quick.)
- Apple Pencil Pro.
- That Procreate transition was pretty cool.
- Squeeze gesture with haptics. (Haptics would actually be pretty cool)
- Gyroscope.
- Find My on Apple Pencil. Neat
- Procreate CEO gets airtime. Fitting.
- Pencil Pro works with iPad Air as well.
- (Does regular pencil work on new iPad Pro?)
- $999 starting price. That's gone up, hasn't it?
- iPad base model price drop. Nice.
- iPad mini gets a shoutout
- Yep, shot on iPhone again!

Pretty short event as expected. Rumours got pretty much everything right. While the new iPad Pros look very nice, I don't use the iPad quite enough to justify the price, although I'm kinda interested in an 11" Air to replace my 2017 10.5" iPad Pro.

Just a quick detail I noticed on the website: the new iPads, both Air and Pro, support the new Pencil Pro and USB-C Pencil. So the 1st and 2nd gen Pencils are effectively outdated, although still very much on sale.
