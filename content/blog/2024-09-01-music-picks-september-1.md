Here is some of the music I've been enjoying in the past weeks:

- [Oscillator - Make Them Suffer](https://open.spotify.com/track/5okINwfVHGbyilUmzJSeIN?si=74bf3cb9c3634cb9)

Make Them Suffer's latest single is heavy, blending their new industrial sound with a bit of their older, blackened sound. Their next album comes out 8 November, and a week later they're playing a show here in Auckland. You already know I bought tickets, November can't come soon enough.

- [HOW 2 GET AWAY WITH MURDER - South Arcade](https://open.spotify.com/track/2VoU7RnUBTp3mxFJBhUIPX?si=d13ec013688049d3)

I first discovered these guys on Instagram with their song DANGER, and I fell in love ever since. Super fun 2000s-grunge-pop sound with modern auto-tuned vocals which works really well. Their latest single is a banger and the breakdown with car samples is just brilliant.

- [Heart-Shaped Box - Marcin](https://open.spotify.com/track/49ZqzWNFWJJpXUoDH0ZaC3?si=7f16e6c3eb9d45cd)

Guitar virtuoso Marcin is releasing his first full-length album "Dragon in Harmony" on 13 September. At first I wasn't sure if I would be into his original music, but the first two original singles have not disappointed at all. His latest single is a cover of Nirvana's Heart-Shaped Box. It's melodic, groovy, and of course has insane guitar flex as you would expect from Marcin.

- [Seven - Anberlin](https://open.spotify.com/track/7BjXA8iyZesD4gyCrwXUrB?si=04d3c190da584307)

This new song featuring Matty Mullins does not sound like Anberlin at all. But I don't mind, I'm a fan of Mullins and this song goes really hard.
