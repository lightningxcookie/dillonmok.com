As a big Apple fan and music nerd, I loved [Twenty Thousand Hertz](https://www.20k.org)'s [podcast](https://www.20k.org/episodes/the-sound-of-apple) [series](https://www.20k.org/episodes/the-sound-of-apple-2) on Apple sound design. It's super fascinating to hear about the process and decisions that went into designing the system sounds and ringtones. I've tried designing my own alert sounds before and as simple as they may seem, creating sounds that are effective and sound nice is deceptively difficult. 

It's a shame that many people, including myself, use their devices in silent mode 99% of the time and therefore don't get to experience these highly-crafted sounds. I got my first Apple Watch earlier this year, and while there are several lovely sounds unique to the device, I put it on silent mode shortly after setting it up.

That said, I am still highly familiar with all the iconic sounds from hearing them out in the world and from when I used to have device sounds years ago. I knew about the "Note" sound being a C on a glockenspiel (I remember trying to play this sound on my high school's glockenspiel!), but I didn't know about the "Chord" sound played on a karimba. I would love to get my hands on one, not only to play the alert sound (although that's the first thing I would try!) but it also looks like a fun instrument to play with some cool musical opportunities.
