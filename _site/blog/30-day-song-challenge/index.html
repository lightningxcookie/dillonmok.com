<h1 class="post-title">The 30 Day Song Challenge</h1>
<p class="post-date">06 July 2024</p>

<p>I thought it would be a fun challenge for myself to post a new guitar cover every day for 30 days during my uni break. It would be good way to get me practicing guitar and working on my transcribing, composition, and recording skills.</p>
<p>I asked my friends on Instagram for song suggestions, which allowed me to discover and play music that I'm not so familiar with, as well as get others involved and excited about the challenge.</p>
<p>It also serves as a bit of a content creation experiment. People always say that you need to post regularly on platforms like Instagram or YouTube if you want to be successful and picked up by the algorithm. This challenge was the perfect opportunity to put that to the test. One month is not very long and regular uploads does not guarantee results, nor do I expect my videos to go viral or anything, but I was interested to see what would happen anyway. I have been shooting my covers as 45-60 second vertical videos and posting them to Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts and TikTok.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, I'm currently on Day 19 of the challenge. I'll do a full writeup about the results at the end, but I'm happy to say that I have not yet missed a day. I'm enjoying the process of recording these covers and writing a short solo/guitar part over these songs (most of which do not have solos or lead guitar parts).</p>
<p>If you want to follow along on the final 12 days of this challenge, or go back and watch any of the previous days, you can find it all on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLzp1K-1e4dpjmObFSkIhsA">YouTube channel</a>. Any support is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>I will leave you with one of my favourite covers of the series so far, First Love/Late Spring by Mitski.</p>
