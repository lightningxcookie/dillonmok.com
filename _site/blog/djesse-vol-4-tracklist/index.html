<h1 class="post-title">Jacob Collier&#39;s Djesse Vol. 4 Tracklist</h1>
<p class="post-date">19 January 2024</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Idd9Yqk-vT8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Idd9Yqk-vT8</a><br>
Jacob Collier revealed the track list for his upcoming album &quot;Djesse Vol. 4&quot; and I couldn't be more excited. The five singles we've heard are all great, and with this tracklist and featured artists revealed, the album is shaping up to be a doozy.</p>
<p><strong>TRACK 1: 100,000 Voices</strong></p>
<p>This is the track sampling all the audience choirs throughout the Djesse World Tour. Jacob's been teasing this one for a while, I just know he's gonna do something insane.</p>
<p><strong>Track 2: She Put Sunshine</strong></p>
<p>We don't get much of a teaser for this song, but we do hear the lyrics &quot;she illuminates me&quot; with an upbeat, happy chord progression. So far I'm liking what I hear, excited for this one.</p>
<p><strong>Track 3: Little Blue (feat. Brandi Carlile)</strong></p>
<p>This song is beautiful and lovely. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQvzX0Z3HE4">Mahogany Session</a> version he did live with fans in London is a must-watch and 8 minutes well worth the time.</p>
<p><strong>Track 4: WELLLL</strong></p>
<p>My favourite song of the singles, it's his foray into a rockier sound and the video saw the introduction of his custom Strandberg. I hope we hear more of this sound in the rest of the album.</p>
<p><strong>Track 5: Cinnamon Crush (feat. Lindsey Lomis)</strong></p>
<p>I was not familiar with Lindsey Lomis so I checked out her popular songs on Spotify. She's got a great voice which I can see fitting nicely with Jacob's.</p>
<p><strong>Track 6: Wherever I Go (feat. Lawrence &amp; Michael McDonald)</strong></p>
<p>Great groovy, soulful vibes on this one.</p>
<p><strong>Track 7: Summer Rain (feat. Madison Cunningham &amp; Chris Thile)</strong></p>
<p>This song was not released as a single but they've played it live. Jacob and Madison's vocal harmonies with the acoustic guitar and Chris Thile's mandolin sound heavenly.</p>
<p><strong>Track 8: A Rock Somewhere (feat. Anoushka Shankar &amp; Varijashree Venugopal)</strong></p>
<p>I'm interested to hear Collier's take on Indian music with Venugopal, an amazing singer, and Shankar, an incredible sitar player.</p>
<p><strong>Track 9: Mi Corazón (feat. Camilo)</strong></p>
<p>The four seconds we hear of this song sounds like a dance <em>banger</em>. Camilo has 19M monthly listeners on Spotify and Latin pop is very popular right now, at least on Spotify. I'm guessing this song will help bring Collier's music to a new audience.</p>
<p>(I wrote this post before Mi Coraźon came out as a single. My reaction to the song can be found <a href="../mi-corazon-jacob-collier">here</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Track 10: Witness Me (feat. Shawn Mendes, Stormzy &amp; Kirk Franklin)</strong></p>
<p>Great song with a warm, wholesome vibe. I'm a big fan of Stormzy's track &quot;This is What I Mean&quot; so it's cool to hear him feature on a Jacob track. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb0ge6rIg-w">music video</a> is fun and lovely too.</p>
<p><strong>Track 11: Never Gonna Be Alone (feat. John Mayer &amp; Lizzy McAlpine)</strong></p>
<p>Another beautiful song. Love Lizzy's voice. And you can't go wrong with John Mayer's killer touch on the guitar.</p>
<p><strong>Track 12: Bridge Over Troubled Water (feat. John Legend &amp; Tori Kelly)</strong></p>
<p>Looks like he's finally doing a full version of his cover of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9RUgsD8dRY">Bridge Over Troubled Water</a>. Going to be some classic Jacobean acapella with the vocal chops of Tori Kelly and John Legend.</p>
<p><strong>Track 13: Over You (feat, aespa &amp; Chris Martin)</strong></p>
<p>Jacob's worked with Chris Martin/Coldplay before, but was not expecting a crossover with Aespa. Consider me intrigued.</p>
<p><strong>Track 14: Box Of Stars Pt. 1 (feat. Kirk Franklin, CHIKA, D Smoke, Sho Madjozi, Yelle &amp; Kanyi Mavi)</strong></p>
<p>Don't really know what to expect with this song, but that is a stacked list of featured artists and we hear what sounds to be an African-folk inspired teaser.</p>
<p><strong>Track 15: Box Of Stars Pt. 2 (feat. Metropole Orkest, Suzie Collier, Steve Vai &amp; VOCES8)</strong></p>
<p>Jacob worked with Metropole Orkest for most of Djesse Vol.1, with VOCES8 on the intro track and his mum Suzie on &quot;Onto You&quot;. Now throw in Steve Vai (who's on &quot;Can You Feel The Love&quot;) and this song is going to be crazy. The teaser sounded Djesse Vol. 1-like.</p>
<p><strong>Track 16: World O World (feat. The Aeolians of 2018, Jason Max Ferdinand)</strong></p>
<p>He's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwxRyUnujvg">performed this one live</a> back in September, and what a way to end the album and the whole Djesse project.</p>
<hr>
<p>I'm really looking to Djesse Vol. 4 and listening to the rest of the tracks. From what we hear in the teaser this album is like the encapsulation of the past three albums: we hear the orchestral stuff, the mellow acoustic stuff, and some pop/electronic stuff, with many returning featured artists and many new ones too. February 29 is going to be special this year.</p>
