<h1 class="post-title">Thoughts on Tidal</h1>
<p class="post-date">31 May 2024</p>

<p>I have been on the free trial of music streaming service Tidal. Here are my thoughts so far as a usual Spotify user:</p>
<ul>
<li>This app feels like Spotify if the designers actually cared about music. No audiobooks, no podcast junk, just pure music and it's glorious.</li>
<li>The Mac app is solid. Apple Music is stuck in its iTunes roots and Spotify is a poor use of screen space.</li>
<li>The Tidal credits view is awesome. I wish Spotify showed credits more prominently instead of keeping it in a pop-up window.</li>
<li>Tidal's algorithmic mixes are quite good, a good variety of stuff I'm not as familiar with rather than Spotify's mixes which are just the same few songs on repeat</li>
<li>I like having a shuffle button that actually shuffles the music instead of whatever Spotify's does</li>
<li>Can't say I've watched any music videos on Tidal, but I'd much rather have this music-related content than podcasts</li>
<li>Tidal music quality is good, about the same as Apple Music from what I can tell. Where in the world is Spotify Hi-Fi?</li>
<li>Spotify search is still superior in surfacing the stuff I'm looking for. Tidal search on the desktop also seems a bit broken, sometimes I need to click back into the search field and hit Enter for it to trigger the search.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I've enjoyed checking out Tidal and seeing what other streaming services have to offer. While I have good things to say about it, I'll go back to Spotify as I'm on a family plan and likely can't convince my family to move to another service.</p>
