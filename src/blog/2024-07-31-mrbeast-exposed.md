A person on YouTube, going by the name [DogPack404](https://www.youtube.com/@DogPack404) uploaded a 53-minute-long video exposing MrBeast's shady manipulation tactics and claiming that he fakes videos and runs illegal giveaways.

I've watched my fair share of MrBeast videos over the years. While I'm no superfan and have not spent any money on his merch or products, I have enjoyed his videos in the past, and have a lot of respect for the work he does.

If something seems too good to be true, that's because it most likely is. And that would seem to be the case with MrBeast.

I'm a little disappointed in myself that I trusted MrBeast this whole time- I guess I didn't have any reason to question him, especially when many other YouTubers only had good things to say about him.

Thinking about it now, other content creators are _incentivised_ to build a good business relationship with him, the biggest creator on YouTube. That's how they fool you.

So the bottom line is, don't believe everything you see on the Internet. I thought I had a good feel of what's what, but this has been a reminder that I need to stay vigilant.
