Here's a quick non-comprehensive list of what I'd like to see at this year's WWDC:

1. Make Shortcuts great again. Fix the editor and add more actions. Improve the alerts and dialogs on the Mac. 
2. I'd love to see a standalone Passwords app.
3. Fix home screen widgets being unresponsive/not loading.
4. Revamp the Music app on the Mac and get rid of its iTunes roots.
5. Access to the full SF Symbols catalog in more places, such as Reminders, Notes, and Shortcuts.
6. Updates to the Journal app: allow third-party apps to make journal suggestions. Search bar, more sorting options, a calendar view. The ability to import/export data would be nice for peace of mind :)
7. More system widgets and clock styles for StandBy.
8. Allow JIT compilation on the App Store. More emulators!
9. Maybe WWDC isn't the right place, but I'd love to see some updates to Logic plugins, for example Amp Designer. It hasn't been changed for years and amp sim technology has greatly improved since, I would love to see Apple take another stab at it.
