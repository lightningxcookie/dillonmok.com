Last week, I released an album.

I wrote these songs back in 2021. It was a transitional time of my life, before and at the beginning of my military service in Singapore. While they're not masterpieces, these songs still mean a lot to me and represent what was going on in my head at the time. 

This album has been my labour of love for the past year. While I recorded demos for all the songs as I wrote them, I slowly went through and rerecorded tracks and cleaned up parts to make them ready for release. Through this process I learned a lot about songwriting, arrangement, and music production. 

It feels great to have finally released these songs to the world. Now that I'm free from the curse of unfinished projects I can move on to writing new, better music. 

Please enjoy. More music coming soon.
