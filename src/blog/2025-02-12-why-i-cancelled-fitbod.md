excerpt: My thoughts on Fitbod after using it for a year.

At the end of 2023, I decided to sign up for [Fitbod](https://fitbod.me) after hearing about on [Relay](https://www.relay.fm) shows (I did take advantage of a discount code. I may not have tried the app if not for this). After a year of using the app, here are my thoughts.

What attracted me to Fitbod at first was the personalised training plans. I was doing some basic routines before, but it got a little boring doing the same exercises week after week, so I greatly appreciated the variety of Fitbod's routines. While many exercises were repeated, each day was never the same as another. It made working out more fun, removing the decision making and I just had to follow what it told me almost like a list of tasks to complete in a game.

As somewhat of a gym beginner at the time, I always felt uncertain whether what I was doing was the most optimal way to train. Having this app guide me, tell me what to do each day and progress over time was very nice. It exposed me to new exercises that I could do with the equipment I had at home, and over time I got a better understanding of different exercises and what makes a good training session.

Now this is partially why I decided to cancel my Fitbod subscription after a year. I've since become more experienced in the gym and no longer feel the need for an app to guide me on my workouts. My priorities changed and I feel I'm no longer taking full advantage of the app, instead just using it to log my workouts. This purpose can be better served (and at a lower cost) by an app such as [Strong](https://www.strong.app), which is what I have switched to from Fitbod. 

No fault to Fitbod, there were periods throughout last year where I did not work out for a few weeks (either due to sickness or lack of time from studies or other commitments) and therefore did not use the app. I can't justify paying the full price for another year of Fitbod if I won't be making full use of it (either from the features or just lack of using it at all).

Overall, I would recommend Fitbod to anyone who wants a nice, premium app with personalised workouts and tracking. While it's not the best app to suit my needs anymore, I was pretty satisfied with it and am glad to have tried it out for a year. Who knows, maybe in another year or two I'll be back to using Fitbod, but for now I have been happy using Strong for the past few months.
