This song goes back to the darker, edgy style like we heard on Trench. I wasn't really a fan of Scaled and Icy so I'm excited they are back to this sound. Josh Dun killing it on the drums as usual. I can't wait for the rest of this album.

Last week they released a 4-minute video explaining the lore of the past few albums. Worth checking out for a refresher, or like me you don't follow the lore too closely. It seems the Scaled and Icy part of the story has passed, which is fine by me :)
