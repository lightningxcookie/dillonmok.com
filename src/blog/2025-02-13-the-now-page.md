Inspired by [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/), [Stephen Hackett](https://512pixels.net/) and many others who have come before me, I have created a [now page](/now) on my website. This is one of few additions to the site thanks to the recent [rewrite](/blog/website-revamp-2025) using Eleventy that is now super easy for me to implement.[^1]

For those unaware, a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about) is simply a page you periodically update and talk about what's been going in your life recently. I'm planning to update mine every few weeks, but we'll see how it goes with my schedule. It might be more frequent or less frequent. I also need to implement some version control/backlog mechanism, but that's a project for another time.

[^1]: Another one being this very footnote which you are now reading! How cool is that, I just had to add a plugin to my Eleventy config file and I was off to the races.
