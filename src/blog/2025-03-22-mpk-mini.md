excerpt: Breathing new life into an old keyboard controller

Recently my dad gave me his old [Akai MPK Mini MKII MIDI controller](https://www.akaipro.com/mpk-mini-mkii) with a few dead keys. I found this helpful [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGEx6Go-qbA) by EducationAboutStuff who, having the same issue with his keyboard, fixed it using copper tape to reinforce the conductive contacts which power the keys. I only followed the first step which is cleaning the membrane layer and underlying circuit board, but it worked like a charm. No more dead keys and the keyboard seems to be working as good as new. 

Hooray for easy-to-repair electronics. I even found a [third-party alternative](https://github.com/PiOverFour/MPK-M2-editor) to the MPK mini editor software (which is unfortunately not compatible with Apple Silicon Macs) so I can edit all the button and knob mappings. Just like that, I've saved $229 from not needing to buy a brand new MIDI controller. More than ten years after its release, the MPK mini mkII lives on.
