Last week, I upgraded to [Moom 4](https://manytricks.com/moom/). 

I have held off from upgrading since it came out in August, because frankly I didn't feel any need to. 

What led to me finally bite the bullet was the Use Grid feature. It was previously accessible through the green button palette, although I was able to trigger it via keyboard shortcut with a hidden feature flag. In Moom 4, it is now an official feature exposed in the UI, and has finer controls for the grid size. The maximum grid division used to be 25x25, which was fine but felt a little large on my Studio Display, and had the downside of not dividing the screen perfectly in half. With this latest version, it goes up to 50x50. For now I have it set to 30x30, although I will definitely play around with this setting to dial it in.

I like the new animations when move-and-resizing windows, they are subtle but makes the app feel more native and integrated into the OS. I haven't played around with all the new features in Moom 4 too much, although I'm excited to check out the new Drop Zones and customisable snap zones.
