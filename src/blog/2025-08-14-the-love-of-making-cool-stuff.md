excerpt: Thoughts after my first hackathon.

Two weeks ago, I participated in my first [hackathon](https://wdccxsesahackathon.com).

It was tiring, but it was also an incredibly fun two days.

I loved seeing everyone's creative and interesting ideas. It left me feeling inspired to build cool stuff.

If I had infinite time, I would be starting side projects and tinkering with new ideas, jumping on them as soon as they come to me. Is that a sustainable thing to do? Probably not, but it would be great for learning.

With the rise of AI coding tools, it's now much easier to build working app prototypes. Are these "vibe-coded" apps production-ready? No, but for a quick proof-of-concept and to test ideas, these tools are perfect and a huge productivity boost.

No matter what tools you use though, software development is all about designing solutions and executing great ideas. AI tools are powerful but will never replace human creativity. With the current technology landscape, there are a hundred different ways to build an app, so there's no excuse to not work on those ideas.
