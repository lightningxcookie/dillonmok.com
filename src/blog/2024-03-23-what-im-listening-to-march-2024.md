title: "What I’m Listening To (March 2024)"

Since I have no idea what to write about for this week, I thought I'd just share the music I'm into at the moment. Serving as a time capsule to capture what I am listening to at the end of March 2024.

**1. [Twenty One Pilots - Overcompensate](https://open.spotify.com/track/0wEGo9LsSrSUz9HOtraWAO?si=cad42e4f583743af)**

Really solid first single from their upcoming Clancy- which I wrote about [here](https://dillonmok.com/articles/twenty-one-pilots-clancy/).

**2. [Jacob Collier - Djesse Vol. 4](https://open.spotify.com/album/13r6eqjYlKELFQlNvVCBz1?si=bgAEZUicRNWP6wmuyZTqmQ)** 

This album has been out for nearly a month and it's still on daily repeat on me. Just so many mindblowing songs. I should probably write a full review of the album at some point.

**3. [Haken - Fauna](https://open.spotify.com/album/62Z9kh3RuUnkXrnyhHWJPX?si=akyZ1i-tQ4atntP889poug)**

Really good prog metal album that I first found through the Elephants Never Forget guitar playthrough on YouTube.

**4. [Poppy - I Disagree](https://open.spotify.com/album/4uTce2w80loIu3oLnW0irN?si=QUrh-AdGRVK6aVUzaZm-Rw)**

I'm a little late to this album, only discovering it late last year. Concrete and I Disagree are great metal-pop songs, but some of the later tracks, especially the ending Don't Go Outside are kinda underrated. Unfortunately Poppy's last album isn't as heavy, or good as this one.

**5. [Genesis Owusu - Struggler](https://open.spotify.com/album/1mzWBk8fzEEMumcy5IuVcf?si=cptr0UFvTvmW4kKo6dGV0w)**

A friend of mine recommended this album to me. It's a wonderful mix of rap, R&B, 80's, pop and rock that sounds really fresh.
