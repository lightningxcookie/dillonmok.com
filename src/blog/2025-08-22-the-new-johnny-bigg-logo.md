excerpt: Thoughts on the new Johnny Bigg logo.

My favourite clothing store, [Johnny Bigg](https://www.johnnybigg.com.au/nz), recently changed their logo.

When I first saw it, I thought there was a rendering issue on the website, like the font didn't load.

But then seconds later it dawned on me that it was just a new logo.

Sigh. Yet another brand to change their logo to "just a font", removing all traces of personality and originality.

Their old logo looked classy and it was recognisable from across a shopping mall. Their new one looks like the placeholder image for a phone contact. It couldn't be more basic, just black text on a white background in a boring sans-serif font. Anyone could recreate this in a _text editor_ in under 30 seconds. They haven't rolled out this logo to stores yet but I guess it will blend in with all the other fashion stores.

I still love their clothes and continue to buy them, but this new logo is just very disappointing.
