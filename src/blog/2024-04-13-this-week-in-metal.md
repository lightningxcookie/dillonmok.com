In the last two weeks or so we've seen the release of lots of new music in the modern metal/hard rock scene. There are too many good bands to list them all, so instead here are some my favourite new releases:

- [Knocked Loose - Don't Reach For Me](https://open.spotify.com/track/3pFg2UmSItBn9Zj8AmVse7?si=eb3c8ce9fc884ebe)

Their album "You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To" comes out on 10 May.  I can't wait to hear what Knocked Loose and Poppy can come up with in the song "Suffocate", Poppy doing more heavy stuff is what I need in my life.  There's also "Slaughterhouse 2", the sequel of the song featuring Knocked Loose on Motionless in White's latest album. 

- [Make Them Suffer - Epitaph](https://open.spotify.com/album/7340cq15lz7sWSF1wiFvA9?si=6Ai8ATERQsKznM04DhntVQ)

Super riffy and heavy. Sam and Alex's vocals are on point. MTS need to release a new album already.

- [Architects - Curse](https://open.spotify.com/track/65VHUZPZKgaG4SJVRkBPzn?si=e551211008404db9)

Architects with Jordan Fish and Nolly, this song has a huge chorus and great production. 

- [Alpha Wolf - Half Living Things](https://open.spotify.com/album/1j7zqEn1vwEA5yfGnRdq9q?si=FyKYNXwgRGSFMjd54dvS-Q)

I'm not too familiar with Alpha Wolf's previous music, but this is a solid album of heavy bangers. Gonna be checking out their discography after this one. The outro track "Ambivalence" is my favourite on this album.

- [SeeYouSpaceCowboy... - Red Wine and Discontent](https://open.spotify.com/album/3ywk7LvbM9ZZEHBb2pD5mz?si=4rZKSF4_TnaLGGxsPrxmbA)

I recently got into these guys- they're making emo metal like it's the 2010s (think ADTR) and I love it. Their new album "Coup de Gr√¢ce" comes out on 19 April and all the singles have been great.

- [Nothing More - HOUSE ON SAND (feat. Eric Vanlerberghe)](https://open.spotify.com/album/6rxuvZ6hUgbhEH1J4wrcXu?si=gQue6rZ1Rxiy0KdAU3lKeA)

It doesn't feel like long since Nothing More's last album in October 2022, but their next album "CARNAL" comes out 28 June and I am not complaining. The first two singles are very good and classic Nothing More.

Random fun fact: when I was six or seven me and my sisters had (private) WordPress blogs. One of mine was called "Music is Fun Guys" and it was me posting music videos and lyrics to whatever songs I was into at the time. Unfortunately I don't have access to that account or any photographic evidence, but I find it amusing how that's come full circle and that's pretty much what I'm doing now with this blog. Seven-year-old me would be proud.
