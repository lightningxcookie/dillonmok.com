I have been loving the singles from [Bilmuri](https://www.youtube.com/@Bilmuriband), the solo project of Johnny Franck (formerly of Attack Attack!). 

His upcoming album "AMERICAN MOTOR SPORTS" comes out June 28. I would describe this album as country metal, a sound I wasn't sure if I'd be into at first. But the songs are super fun and catchy. Johnny is a really good songwriter and pulls off the mix of country and metal surprisingly well.

All the singles are great, but "TALKIN' 2 UR GHOST" has to be my favourite.
