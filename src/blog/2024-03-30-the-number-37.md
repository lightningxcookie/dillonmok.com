After watching this fascinating video by [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium) yesterday (if you're not subscribed to him, what are you doing?) I started seeing the number 37 everywhere. A Spotify playlist I just made yesterday was 37 minutes long. I had 37 minutes tracked in [Timery](https://timeryapp.com) for the day. Today when filming some videos for YouTube one of my clips was shot at 11:37. 

Yes, my brain is now primed to look for the number, and if I was looking for another number I might well get the same result. But it is certainly interesting finding this number in the wild, one which seem random but has deep significance in mathematics and might not be so random after all.
