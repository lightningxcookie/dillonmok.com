I'm writing this the weekend before the university year starts for 2025. 

I had an amazing summer. I got to experience lots of new things, take time to relax and enjoy myself while spending time with friends and family. I'm excited for the year ahead entering the second year of my engineering degree. 

## How I've Been Spending My Time

- I've been learning the basics of vim through vimtutor. I had no idea this existed until a few days ago. Previously I only knew how to do two things in vim: insert mode and save and exit. It was enough for the rare occasions I needed to use vim (usually it was because I found myself in it after running some command), but I never enjoyed it. Now, I'm taking to time to properly learn and I already feel much more comfortable using vim and finally understand it. My vim usage will continue to be limited but now I won't be scared the next time I find myself editing a text file through the command line. 

- I'm brushing up on my guitar fretboard with [Fretboard Forever](https://fretboardforever.app). Great little practice tool.

- I'm trying out [Sonofield](https://et.sonofield.com) for ear training exercises. I've only done the Degrees mode but I'm liking it so far. It's got a nice UI and pretty sounds. (I've been doing interval recognition exercises on [musictheory.net](https://www.musictheory.net) / [Tenuto](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tenuto/id459313476) throughout the past year.)

## Things I'm Enjoying

- Dal Av and Jackson Rose's [Petrichor](https://open.spotify.com/album/2ZfQiShw046FRc7Si6cx3M?si=CC7ZeE7kR1yTRNHBY6F9VA) album is very good. It's heavy, slammy, has great modern production and goes hard especially at the gym.

- The new [Architects album](https://open.spotify.com/album/2W82VyyIFAXigJEiLm5TT1?si=bl9ILyEVSXavLhZKKXYYMA) is also pretty good.

- One of the things I'm playing with this year as part of my Year of Systems is a daily habit/actions tracker. I did this on paper for a few weeks and now I'm trying [Awesome Habits](https://www.awesome-habits.com). It's got great data visualisation and allows me to do "half-completed" tasks which contribute to the overall completion score of each day. So far I'm enjoying it and it's been a somewhat good way to make sure I'm spending time on my priorities.

- I'm currently playing my way through [Chrono Trigger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger). This game has an intriguing story.
