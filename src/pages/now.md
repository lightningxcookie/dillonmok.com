Here's what I've been up to:
- I'm heading into exam season for this semester. I've got three exams in the span of three weeks. Afterwards I will hopefully have more time for writing blog posts.

- Last year I went all-in on Obsidian for note-taking. It hasn't been as good I originally hoped, mainly because the Obsidian iPhone app remains janky. I have now gone back to Apple Notes for my random, everyday notes, but remain using Obsidian for study notes, project notes and blogging (things I did not access on my phone anyway).

- I bought a Nintendo Switch a few weeks ago. I got a good deal on a second-hand OLED model (it was practically brand new), and am having fun playing Mario Kart 8 (it's satisfying all my cravings for Sonic and SEGA All-Stars Racing) and Pico Park.

And for the media I've been enjoying:

- Jon Bellion's new album _FATHER FIGURE_ is really good. I fell in love with Jon Bellion with _The Human Condition_, then his next album _Glory Sound Prep_ was good but didn't capture me the same way. This new album has the same magic as the _The Human Condition_, at least for me. These albums are the my jams for my second year of high school and university respectively. Coincidence?

- [_NEVER ENOUGH_](https://open.spotify.com/album/52yD51X7yDinwlg6tbCtpP?si=HKm4To2YSWOdSqkrnO9yxQ) is Turnstile's new album. There are a lot of great songs on this one, their sound continues to evolve from the previous album _GLOW ON_ with more electronic sounds, while keeping the heavy guitars and massive drums. I want to give a shoutout to the trumpet part in _DREAMING_, it made me really happy when I first heard it.
