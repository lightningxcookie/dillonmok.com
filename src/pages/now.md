Hello Internet! We're five weeks into the university year but it still feels like it only just begun. They say time flies when you're having fun, so I guess that's a good sign. Here's what I've been up to:

- I made a rock remix/guitar cover of Playboi Carti's [EVIL J0RDAN](https://youtu.be/KJtGmQY3zq4). I took inspiration from Spiritbox's remix of [Cobra](https://youtu.be/NMf3_lPGBq4) (by Megan Thee Stallion) and I'm quite happy with how it turned out.

- Fifteen months after printing them, I finally handed out the last of my tall business cards. That means I get to design some new ones! I have designed and printed new cards already, and I will write a blog post about them once I start handing them out and get people's reactions. 

- Working on a new content update for Mochi Pets. Stay tuned! üêª

And some content I've been enjoying:

- I recently found out that Justifide's [The Vault Sessions](https://open.spotify.com/album/3npWAJy9MIHpivMwH9eyyB?si=MJ84b_zTQe6lJ91U5Ob9-w) is back on Spotify! I was obsessed with "The End" so I was sad when it dropped off Spotify a few years ago. I'm super happy that it's back, and now I've gone down the Justifide rabbit hole of listening to their other two albums. I'm digging them so far, their Christian nu-metal sound reminds me a lot of Blindside.

- Speaking of Blindside, they finally released a new song! [Dead Weight](https://open.spotify.com/album/4xfDCq11r0Kka6CG1hhgp6?si=OEmKMhlETuGNcQap8F02qA) is a banger and sounds like a classic Blindside song. I really hope we see more music soon, maybe even an album.

- Spotify put me onto [Lonely People With Power](https://open.spotify.com/album/5Eh3xMVdGFAUiYwuoPOzXc?si=iI6jjDjHT8SvjcXR-Dq4pg) by Deafheaven, a band I was not familiar with. The best way I can describe this album is shoegaze death metal, which works surprisingly well. It's a vibe for sure.
