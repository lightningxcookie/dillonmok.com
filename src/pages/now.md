_Last updated 10 August 2025_

It's been a minute since I have updated this page. Missed the entire month of July, but I'm back now.

## What I've Been Up To
- I'm trying out [Todoist](http://todoist.com/) as my task manager. It's too early to comment on anything yet, but I'll share thoughts as I get into it more.

- After initial tests in the Simulator, Mochi Pets appears to work just fine in the iOS 26 betas. I don't currently have a sacrificial device for testing purposes, although that might change for the public release. For now, I'm experimenting updating our app icons with [Icon Composer](https://developer.apple.com/icon-composer/).

## Media I've Been Enjoying
- I'm a little late to the hype, but I've been really enjoying the song [Will You Love Me When I'm Dead](https://open.spotify.com/album/2zs0gJMS21tocKOXpWvPxU?si=tZa3W02HTh2BD6-ULWR0TA) by Amira Elfeky.

- There's been a bunch of great releases in metal music: Slaughter to Prevail's new album [GRIZZLY](https://open.spotify.com/album/6RIsDIL38i8Z0ftmRChVf2?si=Wbzk0nQFTyugIhoNo6bZkg), Babymetal's new album [METAL FORTH](https://open.spotify.com/album/7JAioi7aQOS0VenAg3xfrp?si=tKvUVLFoS5icqD9yaHEBZQ), and [this EP](https://open.spotify.com/album/7JeN1aczcGqtq4TZ5ljZm9?si=IOLuLALITPyVDSjCQRY7bw) by Deadlands
