I have about three weeks left of summer break before starting my second year of university. My summer has been great so far, I've been spending more time outdoors and going to the gym.

## How I've Been Spending My Time
- I picked up tramping this summer. I've greatly enjoyed going out and walking in the mountains. I took a three-day trip to [Mt Holdsworth](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/wellington-kapiti/places/tararua-forest-park/things-to-do/tracks/mt-holdsworth-jumbo-circuit/) with some mates and had an absolute blast. Looking forward to doing more trips during the year, I have invested in the gear so now I've no excuses.
- I launched a content update of [Mochi Pets](/apps). It's got lots of new foods which look very cool, my sister crushed it with the art as always.
- I'm slowly working on the Android version of Mochi Pets. It's been on the backburner for months, but I'm finally making some more progress thanks to ChatGPT. No timelines yet as it's not easy rewriting an app for another platform while learning the frameworks and language.
- I recently released my debut solo album called [Four Years Ago](/blog/four-years-ago). I'm writing new songs now, look out for more releases throughout the year.

## Media I've Been Consuming
- I recently watched the latest Star Wars trilogy (Episodes VII, VIII and IX) for the first time. I quite liked _The Force Awakens_, _The Last Jedi_ was decent but a bit long, and _The Rise of Skywalker_ was... something else entirely. I already felt bored twenty minutes in, and didn't keep track of how many times I stopped the movie to laugh and/or cringe.
- Now I'm rewatching [Severance](https://tv.apple.com/nz/show/severance/umc.cmc.1srk2goyh2q2zdxcx605w8vtx). It's been two years since I first watched it, and man, it's as good as I remember. Looking forward to watching the new season.
- I'm lowkey obsessed with the [Colors Collapsed](https://open.spotify.com/album/0pKOBFEdVGrZFBXCIJI7Yp?si=TI6aATZ5SNKXZt-sVBM76w) EP by Dal Av and Jackson Rose. Their full-length album [Petrichor](https://open.spotify.com/prerelease/2nf7KQwc7Dq2wrXGABQTyr?si=43e1a0d74ac04af9) comes out next week and I am very excited.
- Through [Dal Av and Jackson Rose](https://open.spotify.com/track/53NIDYSjxw4f7bwd7q13xz?si=6dfb9255f85c4d43) I discovered Vana and am loving her [TRIAL & TERROR](https://open.spotify.com/album/2NjCt56ShHgoHjup5HEbUa?si=3Za1APHXRdSXJ1-Aa8aa9w) EP.

On the nerd side of things, I've been playing with [Remind Me Faster](https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/remind-me-faster/id985555908) and rethinking both my task management and note-taking setups. It's probably not a good idea to do both at the same time, but it's part of my yearly theme of Year of Systems. I want to get my productivity workflows right before the university year starts next month.
