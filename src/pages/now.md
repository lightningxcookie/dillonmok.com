Here's what I've been up to:
- I'm trying out Vim mode in VS Code. Since I spent a bunch of time learning the keybinds through vimtutor, I figured I should put my learning into practice and use it in my daily code editor. My use of VS Code is not super heavy, currently my main uses are writing this blog and university coding assignments, but it's better than not using vim at all.

- I released a metal cover/remix of Ken Carson's [K-HOLE](https://youtu.be/3qArMRW5DWQ). This one went in a different direction to what I was originally expecting, but it turned out great!

- I am working on a new update for Mochi Pets with improvements to the animation system. It may or may not have been heavily inspired by Bryce Bostwick's excellent video about [widget animation workarounds on iOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdJ_y1c_j_I).  

And for the media I've been enjoying:

- New Callous Daoboys album ["I Don't Want to See You in Heaven"](https://open.spotify.com/album/3jTNWEwxFDdNCuHjc3CuHi?si=yV0fp2YgRE6Qu2hSw-GUDQ)

- New Lorna Shore song ["Oblivion"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3Ct6hcluVSYrD2fbUmaRyg?si=9ed8d87994d648ca) is great. Can't wait for their new album dropping in September.

- Catching up on my podcast feed after taking a break from listening to podcasts for Lent.
